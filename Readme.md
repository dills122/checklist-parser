# Checklist Parser

This project is intended to be a Parser for Topps/Panini Checklists of their sports products, with a majority focus on Soccer.

Currently in Early Phase, but have a working example, `example.ts`, which can be run by `npx tsx example.ts`.

So far I have only tested with a single checklist, [2024-25 Topps UEFA Club Competitions](https://www.topps.com/pages/topps-uefa-club-competitions).

## Getting Started

```bash
nvm use lts/iron
npm i -g pnpm # or check website for other install methods
pnpm install
pnpm test

# Run example
npx tsx example.ts
```
